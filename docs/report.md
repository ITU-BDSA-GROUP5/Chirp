# Design and Architecture of _Chirp!_

## Domain model
![Domain Model as Class Diagram](/docs/images/domain_model_diagram.png)

The Author class represents a user in Chirp!.
A Cheep represents the messages shared on the Chirp! platform.
A Cheep is written by an Author, and an Author can write many Cheeps.
An Author can follow, as well as be followed, by another Author.
An Author can like a Cheep. A Cheep can be liked by many Authors.

## Architecture â€” In the small

## Architecture of deployed application

## User activities

The following user activity diagrams are for typical user journeys in our "Chirp!" application.

The figure below illustrates a user journey for an **unauthenticated** user of the application.

The diagram below illustrates a user journey for an **authenticated** user of the application.

The next diagram illustrates a user journey where a user wants to exercise their GDPR rights.

## Sequence of functionality/calls trough _Chirp!_

# Process

## Build, test, release, and deployment
The following UML activity diagrams illustrate the GitHub actions workflows that are run when different criteria are met. This will be briefly described under the respective diagrams.

![UML activity diagram of the build and test workflow.\label{build_test_workflow}](images/Build_test_release_and_deployment/build_and_test_workflow.png)

The workflow on figure \ref{build_test_workflow} is run upon every push to main and pull request to main. It builds and tests to application in order to keep main void of faulty code (as a **safety net**).

![UML activity diagram of the deployment workflow.\label{deployment_workflow}](images/Build_test_release_and_deployment/deployment_workflow.png)

The deployment workflow illustrated on figure \ref{deployment_workflow} is run upon every push to main. Note the redundant "build" step. We do not need this since the "publish" step already builds the application. This redundancy was not noticed during development and has not been removed due to time constraints. The illustration describes the two jobs: "build" and "deploy". Jobs are normally run in parallel, however, these are run sequentially as we do not want to deploy before the application is successfully built.

![UML activity diagram of the release razor workflow.\label{release_workflow}](images/Build_test_release_and_deployment/release_razor_workflow.png)

The release workflow illustrated on figure \ref{release_workflow} only run if a push to main contains a version tag. We've made use of a matrix strategy in order to automatically create multiple parallel job runs that builds, publishes, zips and releases the application for their respective platform.

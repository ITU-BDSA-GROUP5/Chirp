# Design and Architecture of _Chirp!_

## Domain model

Here comes a description of our domain model.

![Illustration of the _Chirp!_ data model as UML class diagram.](docs/images/domain_model.png)

## Architecture â€” In the small

The architecture is illustrated on figure \ref{onion_arch_diagram} with three circles representing the layers of our onion architecture. The legend to the left should be self-explanatory except for the terms Grouping of classes. Grouping of classes refers to a set of classes that serve similar functions e.g. the Repositories - it is an abstraction made to increase readability.

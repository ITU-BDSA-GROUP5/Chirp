## How to run test suite locally
Once you have made _Chirp!_ work locally, you can proceed to running tests. Before the tests can be run, Playwright needs to be properly installed. Here follows a guide to install Playwright correctly:
1. In the terminal, run the command `dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.Playwright.CLI`
2. Navigate to the directory `test\Chirp.Web.End2EndTests`
3. Run the command `playwright install`

Once you have installed Playwright, the tests are now ready to run. Here follows a guide to running our test suite locally (Make sure you have the local _Chirp!_ up and running):

## LLMs, ChatGPT, CoPilot, and others
We have used the following set of LLMs in some manner during the project.

We have used GitHub Copilot in the development process of the project. Copilot has mainly been utilized for generation of small code samples. This was done for a small amount of simple and repetitive methods and functions in the code. In these cases, the generated code was always heavily modified. 
GitHub Copilot's chat functionality within the workspace has also been used for proof of concept. The response helped us to get an idea of, how a certain functionality might be implemented. This would then lead to an inspired but manual implementation of that functionality.

We have also used ChatGPT in some rare cases during the project. This was mainly used for researching purposes to get details about a concept or receive an explanation of some code examples from the internet. The help from ChatGPT primarily helped to faster gain an understanding of a subject, before implementing a feature.

The usage of LLMs did not have a substantial effect on the development speed. In some situations, the LLMs improved our understanding of the given issue, and sped up the research phase. In other situations, the response was misleading or imprecise, which led to more refactoring of the written code.

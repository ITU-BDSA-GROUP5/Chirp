# Design and Architecture of _Chirp!_

## Domain model

Here comes a description of our domain model.

![Illustration of the _Chirp!_ data model as UML class diagram.](docs/images/domain_model.png)

## Architecture â€” In the small

## Architecture of deployed application

## User activities

## Sequence of functionality/calls trough _Chirp!_

# Process

## Build, test, release, and deployment

## Team work

No functionality is incomplete. Planned features we did not get to implement include:

* A character counter when writing cheeps
* Adding liked cheeps to about me page (as well as the "Download my data" json data)

To get an overview of our group work consult \ref{groupwork}.

After an issue has been created. We assign responsibility for it to one or more persons.

We work alone or with pair programming iteratively in research and implement steps until the issue is handled.

Then we create a pull request and notify group members who are not involved. They strive to review within 24 hours. If the request is approved we merge it into the Main branch. Otherwise we evaluate whether or not to continue working on the issue or close it with a comment.

Ideally after merging a tag is applied which causes the main branch to be redeployed.
